Quoting a confidential informant, Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, wrote that Alex Copson, the managing partner of ACU Strategic Partners, told the informant that Flynn would see that the sanctions on Moscow were \\u201cripped up.\\u201d In the letter to Representative Trey Gowdy, the panel\\u2019s Republican chairman, Cummings demanded that Gowdy subpoena documents on the nuclear power plan from the White House, Flynn, Copson, their partners and associates. Cummings said he had found the unnamed informant to be \\u201cauthentic, credible, and reliable,\\u201d and offered to produce the individual for Gowdy. Reuters was unable to identify the informant or independently confirm the information in Cummings' letter, which can be seen here: tmsnrt.rs/2AvwKex. Gowdy told reporters later on Wednesday that he was not  going to have the Oversight Committee look into the issues raised in Cummings letter, because it falls outside the scope of the committee\\u2019s responsibilities. He suggested the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russia\\u2019s role in the 2016 U.S. election, take up the matter. Copson and ACU did not immediately respond to detailed requests for comment, while an attorney for Flynn declined to comment.  The White House referred inquiries to Trump\\u2019s personal White House attorney, Ty Cobb, who declined to comment. If true, the informant\\u2019s story adds new evidence that the project\\u2019s promoters believed that Flynn and Trump backed the plan for a consortium of U.S., Russian and French firms to build and operate 45 nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries. Reuters last week published documents that showed Copson and other plan proponents believed they had Flynn and Trump in their corner. The documents also revealed previously unreported aspects of the ACU proposal, including the involvement of a Russian nuclear equipment manufacturer currently under U.S. sanctions. Flynn was a consultant to ACU from April 2015 to June 2016, according to amended financial disclosure forms he filed in August 2017. Flynn, who served only 24 days as Trump\\u2019s national security adviser, pleaded guilty last week to lying to FBI agents working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller about his contacts with a senior Russian diplomat. Mueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 elections. Cummings wrote that he delayed releasing the letter at Mueller\\u2019s request until the special counsel \\u201ccompleted certain investigative steps. They have now informed us that they have done so.\\u201d  Cummings said the informant, who contacted his staff in  June, met Copson at a Jan. 20 inaugural event in Washington.  The two had not known each other, Cummings said. Copson described the nuclear project and told the informant that he had \\u201cjust got this text message\\u201d from Flynn saying that the plan was \\u201cgood to go\\u201d and that Copson should contact his colleagues to \\u201clet them know to put things in place,\\u201d Cummings wrote. Copson showed the informant the text message, according to Cummings. While the informant did not read the message, he saw the time stamp of 12:11 pm, which was about 10 minutes into Trump\\u2019s inaugural address. \\u201cMike has been putting everything in place for us,\\u201d Copson told the informant, Cummings wrote. \\u201cThis is going to make a lot of wealthy people.\\u201d \\u201cThe whistleblower was extremely uncomfortable with the conversation,\\u201d Cummings wrote. \\u201cWhile at the event, the whistleblower made brief notes of Mr. Copson\\u2019s name and the discussion. The whistleblower left the event shortly thereafter.\\u201d \",\n          \"SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday wrestled with a bid by President Donald Trump to show that his latest travel ban targeting people from six Muslim-majority countries is legal. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hearing in Seattle came two days after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Trump\\u2019s travel ban to take effect while litigation over its ultimate validity unfolds.  The ban targets people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen seeking to enter the United States. The Republican president has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism. The state of Hawaii, however, challenged it in court, and a Honolulu federal judge said it exceeded Trump\\u2019s powers under immigration law. Trump\\u2019s ban also covers people from North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela, but the lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect. The same three judge 9th Circuit panel which limited a previous version of Trump\\u2019s ban heard arguments on Wednesday. Some of the judges appeared more cautious toward the idea of blocking the president\\u2019s policy. Judge Michael Daly Hawkins asked Hawaii\\u2019s lawyers whether Trump\\u2019s latest proclamation is more sound than prior versions. The current one, he said, is based on specific findings that some foreign governments do not share enough information to properly vet immigrants.  \\u201cYou would trust Kim Jong Un to say this person is this person, you gotta let him in?\\u201d Hawkins said. Judge Ronald Gould said the court would issue a ruling \\u201cas soon as practicable.\\u201d Trump issued his first travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries in January, which caused chaos at airports and mass protests.  He issued a revised one in March after the first was blocked by federal courts.  That expired in September after a long court fight, and was replaced with the current version.  The ban has some exceptions. Certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and any applicant can ask for an individual waiver. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is set to hear a separate challenge to the ban on Friday, and the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to ultimately decide the issue in the coming months.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 32,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"December 3, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Once the suspects were cornered, 13 officers fired at the car.\\n\\nThe case prompted an 18-month Department of Justice investigation into the practices of the police. In a scathing report released in December, the department required the city to devise a plan to reform the police force.\\n\\nThe specifics of the settlement were unavailable. Messages left for a Department of Justice spokeswoman and the Cleveland Police Department seeking comment weren't returned.\\n\\nThe Department of Justice's report spared no one in the police chain of command. The worst examples of excessive force involved patrol officers who endangered lives by shooting at suspects and cars, hit people over the head with guns and used stun guns on handcuffed suspects.\\n\\nSupervisors and police higher-ups received some of the report's most searing criticism. The report said officers were poorly trained and some didn't know how to implement use-of-force policies. It also said officers were ill-equipped.\\n\\nMobile computers that are supposed to be in patrol cars often don't work, and, even when they do, officers don't have access to essential databases, the report said.\\n\\nPolice Chief Calvin Williams said in December that while it wasn't easy to have to share the federal government findings with his 1,500-member department he was committed to change.\\n\\n\\\"The people of this city need to know we will work to make the police department better,\\\" Williams said.\\n\\nThe investigation marked the second time in recent years the Department of Justice has taken the Cleveland police to task over the use of force. But unlike in 2004, when the department left it up to local police to clean up their act, federal authorities this time have been negotiating a consent decree designed to serve as a blueprint for lasting change among police. Several other police departments in the country now operate under federal consent decrees that involve independent oversight.\\n\\nThe Department of Justice in the last five years has launched broad investigations into the practices of more than 20 police forces, including in Ferguson, Missouri, where a white police officer shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, and in Baltimore, where another black man, Freddie Gray, suffered a spinal cord injury in police custody and later died. The Brown and Gray cases spawned protests that sometimes turned violent.\\n\\nSaturday's bench verdict on the manslaughter charge against Cleveland patrolman Michael Brelo led to a day of mostly peaceful protests but also more than 70 arrests.\\n\\nTwo other high-profile police-involved deaths still hang over Cleveland, a predominantly black and largely poor city: a 12-year-old boy holding a pellet gun fatally shot by a rookie patrolman and a mentally ill woman in distress who died after officers took her to the ground and handcuffed her.\",\n          \"Print \\nSome worrisome news is breaking across the nation where most Americans are now preparing to deal with a major spike in their already astronomical healthcare costs. The AP is reporting that healthcare premiums are about to rise an average of 25% across the country, even as many American families are already struggling to pay their current premiums. \\nPremiums will go up sharply next year under President Barack Obama\\u2019s health care law, and many consumers will be down to just one insurer, the administration confirmed Monday. That\\u2019s sure to stoke another \\u201cObamacare\\u201d controversy days before a presidential election. \\nBefore taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less. \\nMoreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles. \\n\\u201cConsumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period,\\u201d said Larry Levitt, who tracks the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \\nFox News took the time on Monday to hammer House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for her lies that Obamacare would make it easier for most Americans to get healthcare and that it would keep prices more \\u201caffordable.\\u201d \\nPelosi\\u2019s definition of affordable seems to be the exact opposite of what it actually means, because instead of slowing our rising healthcare costs, prices have actually been climbing higher, faster ! \\nAdministration officials are stressing that subsidies provided under the law, which are designed to rise alongside premiums, will insulate most customers from sticker shock. They add that consumers who are willing to switch to cheaper plans will still be able to find bargains. \\n\\u201cHeadline rates are generally rising faster than in previous years,\\u201d acknowledged HHS spokesman Kevin Griffis. But he added that for most consumers, \\u201cheadline rates are not what they pay.\\u201d \\nSenator Ben Sasse (R-NE) wants to hear the Obama administration and their Democrat allies apologize for the disastrous plan, because thus far it seems to have hurt the average American far more than its helped. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve reached this point because ObamaCare is built on the lie that Washington\\u2019s bureaucrats are smart enough to plan health care for millions of Americans. At every turn \\u2014 whether it\\u2019s CO-OPs collapsing, premiums skyrocketing, or big insurers bailing \\u2014 the American people have paid the price. More spin won\\u2019t solve this \\u2014 it\\u2019s time for the White House to admit that this law isn\\u2019t working.\\u201d \\nThe people of Arizona woke up to even scarier news on Wednesday when they learned that their premiums would be rising by 116% this year! \\nHowever, in Arizona, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark \\u201csecond-lowest cost silver plan\\u201d will jump by 116 percent, from $196 to $422, according to the administration report\\u2026 \\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called the Affordable Care Act a \\u201cfailure.\\u201d \\n\\u201cArizona families are demanding affordability, accessibility and choice when it comes to their health care \\u2013 not the expensive, restrictive and poor quality care that has been forced upon them by Obamacare,\\u201d McCain said in a statement. \\u201cUntil President Obama and Congressional Democrats wake up to the law\\u2019s failure, and until we repeal and replace it with solutions that encourage competition and put patients back in charge, the Washington-knows-best approach will continue to unfairly burden the Arizona families it was supposed to help.\\u201d \\nMeanwhile, it seems that Hillary Clinton hasn\\u2019t gotten the memo about how bad Obamacare has been or about how much it\\u2019s hurt our economy, because she\\u2019s still out there running victory laps for the abysmal failure. \\\"You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.\\\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/TfalVkgAgO \\n\\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 12, 2016 \\nSomebody should probably tell her that the majority of Americans hate Obamacare and would prefer seeing it repealed. \\nIn a summer that saw many insurers drop out of the Affordable Care Act\\u2019s health insurance exchanges, Americans\\u2019 support for the healthcare law continues to be slightly more negative than positive. Now, 44% of Americans support the law, also known as Obamacare, and 51% disapprove of it \\u2014 similar to what Gallup measured last November. \\n51% disapprove of Obamacare (or Hillarycare if you prefer), even worse about 1/3 of Americans say the law has actually HURT them, and long term most Americans think the law will end up either hurting their families or not making any difference at all. \\nHopefully, the Trump campaign is paying attention and will begin hammering away on Obamacare. This is a winning issue for Republicans, and it could be the issue that helps us win in November. \\nArticle reposted with permission from Constitution.com shares\",\n          \"Republicans keep saying they\\u2019ll be ready to act if the Supreme Court upholds the big legal challenge to Obamacare, thereby wiping out financial assistance for millions of people in two-thirds of the states.\\n\\n \\n\\n With the clock ticking down to a ruling, it\\u2019s gotten awfully hard to take the GOP\\u2019s vows seriously.\\n\\nMost experts expect the court to rule on King v. Burwell, as the case is known, on or around June 29, which is the last official day of its term. A victory for the plaintiffs would cut off tax credits that residents in Florida, Texas and 32 other states now use to pay for health insurance they obtain through Healthcare.gov, the federally operated marketplace.\\n\\nThe ranks of the uninsured would swell by more than 8 million, according to an estimate by the Urban Institute. The loss of so many customers would likely force insurance companies to raise premiums and withdraw altogether from some markets, affecting even those customers buying directly from insurers rather than through Obamacare's marketplaces.\\n\\nUnder Supreme Court rules, an order would typically take effect within 25 days of its announcement from the bench. In theory, the court could issue a stay delaying its impact. In practice, legal experts consider such a move both unlikely and of questionable significance, given the tight deadlines that insurers and state regulators face for setting next year's premiums.\\n\\nInfographic by Alissa Scheller for The Huffington Post.\\n\\n \\n\\n Leaders of the Republican Party have cheered on the lawsuit, in some cases filing formal friend-of-the-court briefs in support of it. They have also promised -- in op-eds, speeches and interviews -- to craft a \\u201ctransitional\\u201d plan, or some kind of \\u201coff-ramp,\\u201d if the lawsuit is successful. The goals of such plans, Republican leaders have said, would be to minimize disruption for the people who now depend upon Affordable Care Act tax credits for their insurance, while crafting a long-term replacement scheme that would serve the public better than President Barack Obama\\u2019s health care law has. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was among those who made that promise back in early February, shortly after he took over as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. \\u201cWe have to have a contingency plan,\\u201d Ryan said. \\u201cWe think we need to have an option, a plan, for these states that might find themselves in this difficult position.\\u201d\\n\\n \\n\\n Ryan\\u2019s committee, arguably the most powerful in the House, has direct jurisdiction over health care financing. So how many hearings has it held about these contingency plans?\\n\\n \\n\\n Zero.\\n\\nOver in the Senate, Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has introduced actual legislation and it has nearly 30 co-sponsors, including Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who is the majority leader. But the bill is at best a first draft at legislation and, so far, neither the Finance Committee (which has the most power over health legislation) nor the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (which also has some jurisdiction) has sought testimony or scheduled a hearing -- about either the Johnson bill specifically or, more generally, what to do if the Supreme Court stops the tax credits in those 34 states. \\n\\n \\n\\n No, in the six months since the Supreme Court announced it would hear King v. Burwell, Republicans in Congress have held exactly one formal hearing that focused on the subject. It took place last week, before the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. But the Small Business Committee is among the least powerful in Congress and it has virtually no jurisdiction over health care financing issues. That may explain why it attracted very little interest -- even from committee members, only a handful of whom bothered to show up.\\n\\n \\n\\n A generous takeaway from that hearing -- and lack of others -- is that Republicans are thinking about and working on health care plans much more intensely behind the scenes. Brendan Buck, Ryan\\u2019s spokesman, pointed out to The Huffington Post that Republican leaders have convened a working group to craft a post-King contingency plan -- with Ryan among its leaders. That group is now meeting three times a week, Buck said: \\u201cThey\\u2019re informal, but it\\u2019s an active group.\\u201d \\n\\n \\n\\n In addition, several high-profile conservative intellectuals have been talking and writing actively about how Republicans ought to react if the court takes their side -- and what kind of health care plan Republicans should be proposing as an alternative to the Affordable Care Act, regardless of how the justices rule. Avik Roy, the Manhattan Institute scholar and Forbes columnist now working with former Texas Gov. Rick Perry\\u2019s political action committee, has been outspoken on the need for an alternative. Philip Klein, longtime writer on health care and now managing editor of the Washington Examiner, has written a whole book on the subject.\\n\\n \\n\\n But there's a reason that congressional Democrats spent literally years holding hearings on health care reform and then, in 2009, focusing intensely on legislation for several months. The hearings were sometimes acrimonious and, for reform advocates, the media coverage that testimony and questions generated was a source of never-ending grief. At the same time, these hearings, before the committees that actually had jurisdiction on the issues, were necessary to craft a solution that could accomplish the reform\\u2019s main goals and then rally enough support to make it through Congress.\\n\\nThe kinds of plans Republicans seem to have in mind would require making equally difficult trade-offs and uniting even more fractious groups. Johnson\\u2019s bill, for example, would limit enrollment in plans only to those who already have them, and it would eliminate the individual mandate -- the requirement that people get coverage or pay a fine -- in all of the states. That would force insurers to raise premiums or maybe exit markets altogether.\\n\\nOther Republicans have discussed altering the Affordable Care Act's regulation on premiums, so that insurers could charge less to younger people. But reducing premiums for the young means raising them for the old, which might be hard for Republicans to pull off given that older voters are now their political base.\\n\\nJohnson's bill has gone to the Congressional Budget Office for a formal estimate on its impact, a Johnson spokesperson confirmed. That's meaningful -- and more than can be said of most proposals that Republicans have floated on op-ed pages recently. But if Republicans were serious about crafting a proposal that's capable of avoiding disruption and passing Congress, they would have started hashing out these arguments months ago.\\n\\nOf course, the absence of a public effort to match the public rhetoric matters only if Republicans are actually serious about passing a plan. They may not be. Their real goals may be purely cosmetic -- to insulate the party from a political backlash should millions of people suddenly lose health insurance and, more immediately, to ease the anxiety of Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, either of whom might hesitate to issue a ruling with such potentially devastating consequences to so many people.\\n\\n \\n\\n The lack of hearings obviously doesn\\u2019t prove that Republican leaders have such ulterior, cynical motives. But it makes that theory a lot more plausible.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"FAKE\",\n          \"REAL\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

A devout Muslim woman shows some leg, and more. They take on Pope Francis, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls. There are nuns, priests, rabbis and imams. They laugh at death itself.\\n\\nThe latest edition of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical newspaper attacked last week by Islamist extremists for lampooning the prophet Muhammad, became a symbol of freedom of expression as soon as it hit newsstands Wednesday \\u2014 selling out millions of copies before dawn. Yet, in a country that mobilized Sunday by the millions in support of the paper\\u2019s right to mock, France also found itself facing a mounting debate over the limits of free speech within its borders.\\n\\nFrench authorities on Wednesday detained and charged a notorious comedian, Dieudonn\\u00e9 M\\u2019bala M\\u2019bala, with \\u201cglorifying terrorism\\u201d for an ambiguous Facebook post Sunday that, to some, appeared to show support for the gunman who killed four people in a kosher market Friday.\\n\\nSince last week\\u2019s attacks, at least 54 people have faced similar charges \\u2014 including several underage pranksters and drunken louts who were mouthing off. Authorities have used a beefed up anti-terrorism law passed last year to expedite their cases and issue harsher jail sentences \\u2014 with one offender arrested Saturday already receiving a four-year sentence. The Justice Ministry has also issued fresh orders for prosecutors to crack down on \\u201canti-Semitic and racist acts or speech.\\u201d\\n\\nLaurent L\\u00e9ger, an investigative journalist for Charlie Hebdo who survived the attack, said there was no comparing the newspaper to Dieudonn\\u00e9 \\u2014 a French showman of Cameroonian descent who popularized a Nazi-like salute and who jokes about the Holocaust.\\n\\n\\u201cDieudonn\\u00e9 does not know the Charlie spirit,\\u201d L\\u00e9ger said. \\u201cCharlie never glorified terrorism. Dieudonn\\u00e9 is a bit too quick when he claims that his freedom of speech is being hampered. His attitude is just making things worse by continuing the confusion that is destroying this country.\\u201d\\n\\nYet others disagreed, saying France was in danger of trouncing the very right it is aiming to protect: freedom of expression.\\n\\n\\u201cWe can definitely talk about hypocrisy here,\\u201d said Adrienne Charmet, campaign coordinator for La Quadrature du Net, a Paris-based Internet rights group. \\u201cIn the past days, we have seen a lot of people condemned for putting out words, no matter how condemnable those words, and receiving sentences that seem quite exaggerated.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFrench opinion is split in two,\\u201d she added. \\u201cSome see it as the worst possible response to last week\\u2019s attack, because many of those who have said these things were drunk, or teenagers, who did not know the weight of their words. But there is another segment of the population that does agree, because they feel these people are making themselves accomplices to terror. Either way, this crackdown on freedom of speech is a betrayal of last Sunday\\u2019s march.\\u201d\\n\\nCharlie Hebdo was undoubtedly the hottest property in town Wednesday, with lines snaking for blocks as Parisians clamored for copies that sold out within minutes. An initial print run of 3\\u00a0million copies was expanded to 5\\u00a0million when kiosks across the country ran out.\\n\\nSurviving staff members, who worked day and night after the Jan. 7 attack to ensure the issue came out on time, produced the paper. With their offices still roped off as a crime scene, the staff worked out of a conference room at the left-wing daily Lib\\u00e9ration. The offices there are being guarded around the clock by an extraordinary number of police officers and private security guards.\\n\\nThere was plenty inside the paper to stir controversy. The 16-page edition brims with the sort of irreverent, off-color humor that made Charlie famous \\u2014 and infamous. No one is spared ridicule.\\n\\nIn one cartoon, two hooded terrorists are pictured in heaven, with one asking the other, \\u201cWhere are the virgins?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re with the Charlie staff, loser,\\u201d his accomplice replies.\\n\\nAnother pictures a harried and exhausted cartoonist hunched over his desk, with a caption that reads, \\u201cCartooning at Charlie Hebdo, it\\u2019s 25 years of work.\\u201d The next panel shows hooded gunmen mowing people down with a Kalashnikov, accompanied by the words, \\u201cFor a terrorist, it\\u2019s 25 seconds of work.\\u201d\\n\\nAs ever with Charlie Hebdo, the goal is to provoke, to stir debate and to make people laugh \\u2014 while also reminding anyone who might think otherwise that reading Charlie can be distinctly discomfiting.\\n\\nThe paper\\u2019s lead editorial offers a vigorous defense of secular values, saying that staffers laughed when they heard that the bells of the Cathedral of Notre Dame would ring in their honor.\\n\\n\\u201cThe millions of anonymous people, all the institutions, all the world leaders, all the politicians, all the intellectuals and media figures, all the religious dignitaries who proclaimed this week that \\u2018I am Charlie\\u2019 need to also know that that means, \\u2018I am secularism,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d the editorial says.\\n\\nDelphine Ravion-Casalta, 39, spent an hour and a half visiting three newsstands Wednesday morning before she found her Charlie. She sipped coffee at a cafe, her copy proudly spread out before her, eagerly taking in every word.\\n\\n\\u201cIn France, we\\u2019re still fighting for our freedom,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe had revolution for our freedom. A lot of revolutions. And great men like Voltaire and Rousseau. The fight for those ideas continues.\\u201d\\n\\nThe rush for copies of Charlie Hebdo came as French authorities detained and charged Dieudonn\\u00e9, 48. After the unity march that brought 1.5\\u00a0million people onto the streets of Paris on Sunday, the comedian wrote: \\u201cAfter this historic, no legendary, march, a magic moment equal to the Big Bang which created the Universe, or in a smaller way comparable to the crowning of the [ancient king] Vercing\\u00e9torix, I am going home. Let me say that this evening, as far as I am concerned, I feel I am Charlie Coulibaly.\\u201d\\n\\nCharlie Coulibaly is a reference to both Charlie Hebdo and Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman who killed four people in a Paris kosher market on Friday. The comedian, in a second Facebook post Monday, sought to clarify his remark, saying his purpose was \\u201cto make people laugh, and to laugh at death, since death makes fun of us all, as Charlie very well knows.\\u201d He concluded by saying, \\u201cThey consider me to be Amedy Coulibaly when I am no different from a Charlie.\\u201d\\n\\nValls, speaking in the National Assembly, sought to draw a distinction between the creative caricatures of Charlie Hebdo and the comedian\\u2019s hate-based humor, while insisting that France was not compromising freedom of speech.\\n\\n\\u201cThere is a fundamental difference between the freedom to be impertinent, and anti-Semitism, racism, glorification of terrorist acts and Holocaust denial, all of which are offenses, all of which are crimes, that justice should punish with the most severity,\\u201d he said.\",\n          \"With\\u00a0Western and Iranian negotiators racing toward a June 30 deadline\\u00a0to hammer out the final details of a nuclear deal, the mood is tense.

A devout Muslim woman shows some leg, and more. They take on Pope Francis, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls. There are nuns, priests, rabbis and imams. They laugh at death itself.\\n\\nThe latest edition of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical newspaper attacked last week by Islamist extremists for lampooning the prophet Muhammad, became a symbol of freedom of expression as soon as it hit newsstands Wednesday \\u2014 selling out millions of copies before dawn. Yet, in a country that mobilized Sunday by the millions in support of the paper\\u2019s right to mock, France also found itself facing a mounting debate over the limits of free speech within its borders.\\n\\nFrench authorities on Wednesday detained and charged a notorious comedian, Dieudonn\\u00e9 M\\u2019bala M\\u2019bala, with \\u201cglorifying terrorism\\u201d for an ambiguous Facebook post Sunday that, to some, appeared to show support for the gunman who killed four people in a kosher market Friday.\\n\\nSince last week\\u2019s attacks, at least 54 people have faced similar charges \\u2014 including several underage pranksters and drunken louts who were mouthing off. Authorities have used a beefed up anti-terrorism law passed last year to expedite their cases and issue harsher jail sentences \\u2014 with one offender arrested Saturday already receiving a four-year sentence. The Justice Ministry has also issued fresh orders for prosecutors to crack down on \\u201canti-Semitic and racist acts or speech.\\u201d\\n\\nLaurent L\\u00e9ger, an investigative journalist for Charlie Hebdo who survived the attack, said there was no comparing the newspaper to Dieudonn\\u00e9 \\u2014 a French showman of Cameroonian descent who popularized a Nazi-like salute and who jokes about the Holocaust.\\n\\n\\u201cDieudonn\\u00e9 does not know the Charlie spirit,\\u201d L\\u00e9ger said. \\u201cCharlie never glorified terrorism. Dieudonn\\u00e9 is a bit too quick when he claims that his freedom of speech is being hampered. His attitude is just making things worse by continuing the confusion that is destroying this country.\\u201d\\n\\nYet others disagreed, saying France was in danger of trouncing the very right it is aiming to protect: freedom of expression.\\n\\n\\u201cWe can definitely talk about hypocrisy here,\\u201d said Adrienne Charmet, campaign coordinator for La Quadrature du Net, a Paris-based Internet rights group. \\u201cIn the past days, we have seen a lot of people condemned for putting out words, no matter how condemnable those words, and receiving sentences that seem quite exaggerated.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFrench opinion is split in two,\\u201d she added. \\u201cSome see it as the worst possible response to last week\\u2019s attack, because many of those who have said these things were drunk, or teenagers, who did not know the weight of their words. But there is another segment of the population that does agree, because they feel these people are making themselves accomplices to terror. Either way, this crackdown on freedom of speech is a betrayal of last Sunday\\u2019s march.\\u201d\\n\\nCharlie Hebdo was undoubtedly the hottest property in town Wednesday, with lines snaking for blocks as Parisians clamored for copies that sold out within minutes. An initial print run of 3\\u00a0million copies was expanded to 5\\u00a0million when kiosks across the country ran out.\\n\\nSurviving staff members, who worked day and night after the Jan. 7 attack to ensure the issue came out on time, produced the paper. With their offices still roped off as a crime scene, the staff worked out of a conference room at the left-wing daily Lib\\u00e9ration. The offices there are being guarded around the clock by an extraordinary number of police officers and private security guards.\\n\\nThere was plenty inside the paper to stir controversy. The 16-page edition brims with the sort of irreverent, off-color humor that made Charlie famous \\u2014 and infamous. No one is spared ridicule.\\n\\nIn one cartoon, two hooded terrorists are pictured in heaven, with one asking the other, \\u201cWhere are the virgins?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re with the Charlie staff, loser,\\u201d his accomplice replies.\\n\\nAnother pictures a harried and exhausted cartoonist hunched over his desk, with a caption that reads, \\u201cCartooning at Charlie Hebdo, it\\u2019s 25 years of work.\\u201d The next panel shows hooded gunmen mowing people down with a Kalashnikov, accompanied by the words, \\u201cFor a terrorist, it\\u2019s 25 seconds of work.\\u201d\\n\\nAs ever with Charlie Hebdo, the goal is to provoke, to stir debate and to make people laugh \\u2014 while also reminding anyone who might think otherwise that reading Charlie can be distinctly discomfiting.\\n\\nThe paper\\u2019s lead editorial offers a vigorous defense of secular values, saying that staffers laughed when they heard that the bells of the Cathedral of Notre Dame would ring in their honor.\\n\\n\\u201cThe millions of anonymous people, all the institutions, all the world leaders, all the politicians, all the intellectuals and media figures, all the religious dignitaries who proclaimed this week that \\u2018I am Charlie\\u2019 need to also know that that means, \\u2018I am secularism,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d the editorial says.\\n\\nDelphine Ravion-Casalta, 39, spent an hour and a half visiting three newsstands Wednesday morning before she found her Charlie. She sipped coffee at a cafe, her copy proudly spread out before her, eagerly taking in every word.\\n\\n\\u201cIn France, we\\u2019re still fighting for our freedom,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe had revolution for our freedom. A lot of revolutions. And great men like Voltaire and Rousseau. The fight for those ideas continues.\\u201d\\n\\nThe rush for copies of Charlie Hebdo came as French authorities detained and charged Dieudonn\\u00e9, 48. After the unity march that brought 1.5\\u00a0million people onto the streets of Paris on Sunday, the comedian wrote: \\u201cAfter this historic, no legendary, march, a magic moment equal to the Big Bang which created the Universe, or in a smaller way comparable to the crowning of the [ancient king] Vercing\\u00e9torix, I am going home. Let me say that this evening, as far as I am concerned, I feel I am Charlie Coulibaly.\\u201d\\n\\nCharlie Coulibaly is a reference to both Charlie Hebdo and Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman who killed four people in a Paris kosher market on Friday. The comedian, in a second Facebook post Monday, sought to clarify his remark, saying his purpose was \\u201cto make people laugh, and to laugh at death, since death makes fun of us all, as Charlie very well knows.\\u201d He concluded by saying, \\u201cThey consider me to be Amedy Coulibaly when I am no different from a Charlie.\\u201d\\n\\nValls, speaking in the National Assembly, sought to draw a distinction between the creative caricatures of Charlie Hebdo and the comedian\\u2019s hate-based humor, while insisting that France was not compromising freedom of speech.\\n\\n\\u201cThere is a fundamental difference between the freedom to be impertinent, and anti-Semitism, racism, glorification of terrorist acts and Holocaust denial, all of which are offenses, all of which are crimes, that justice should punish with the most severity,\\u201d he said.\",\n          \"With\\u00a0Western and Iranian negotiators racing toward a June 30 deadline\\u00a0to hammer out the final details of a nuclear deal, the mood is tense.
